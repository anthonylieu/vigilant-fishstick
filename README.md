## Module 6 Assignment - Weather Dashboard

<br>Made sure the weather dashboard had form inputs.</br>
<br>Made sure when I search for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.</br>
<br>Confirmed when I view current weather conditions for that city, I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.</br>
<br>Checked that when I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.</br>
<br>Made sure when I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.</br>
